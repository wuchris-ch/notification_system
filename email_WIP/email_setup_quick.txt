# Quick Email Setup Guide
# ======================

## Current Status:
✅ NTFY notifications are working perfectly!
❌ Email notifications need setup

## Option 1: Use NTFY Only (Recommended)
Since ntfy is working great, you can use it for all family communication:
- Immediate notifications work
- Family members can receive on their phones
- No setup required

## Option 2: Set Up Email (If you really want emails)

### Method A: Configure Mac Mail App
1. Open System Preferences > Internet Accounts
2. Add your Gmail account
3. Make sure "Mail" is enabled
4. Test sending from Mail app first

### Method B: Use Gmail SMTP (More reliable)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail
2. Generate an app password
3. Edit send_email_python.py with your credentials
4. Use the Python script instead

## Recommendation:
Stick with ntfy notifications for now - they're working perfectly and are more immediate than emails!
